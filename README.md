ABOUT
I've modified the RFSniffer program to be used with stdout. This will allow you to not only see the RFcodes on your Raspberry pi but allow you to output to a file and have python read those codes.

I will also add a repository with my Python script that reads these codes in from a file.

1. You will need to clone respository to folder
2. You will need to run the RFSniffer from that location if you are in the folder run ./RFSniffer
